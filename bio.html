Rediff.com praised his performance, stating: "Ram Charan is quite promising. Dance and action appear to be forte. He is rather graceful in the dance numbers. He also stays clear of any oblique reference to his star father by way of dialogue or adopting any particular mannerism or style."[21] His performance in the film earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South and the Nandi Special Jury Award.[22][23]
    After the release of his second film, the fantasy film Magadheera (2009), Charan established himself as one of the leading contemporary actors in Tollywood. The film, in which he played dual roles, was directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and Charan's performance was critically acclaimed. The Times of India stated that "Ram Charan returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. He showcases his horse-riding and dancing skills to perfection."[24] IndiaGlitz commented: "Charan has come up with a mature performance and he has carried the film very well. Both his characters were done justice, and he reminded of his father at many places."[25] Magadheera grossed over ₹150 crores worldwide and held the record of being the highest-grossing Telugu film until 2013 before it was surpassed by Attarintiki Daredi.[26] The film received six Filmfare Awards including two awards – Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and the Nandi Special Jury Award for Charan.</p>

Helped by a strong script, he could have been much better."[39] The film was released on 5 April 2012 and was declared a commercial success.[40]

Charan made his debut as a playback singer with the song "Mumbai Ke Hero", composed by Chirrantan Bhatt, from the album Thoofan, the Telugu version of Zanjeer.[46] Rediff called it as "an unforgivably bad remake."[47] Film critic Rajeev Masand criticised his performance writing that he "comes off as stiff as a wax statue in his Bollywood debut, with barely any emotion, forget brooding anger."[48] Amid huge expectations, the film became a box-office bomb.[49][50]</p>

The Central Board of Film Certification gave the film an 'A' certificate because of its violent action sequences.[51] Bangalore Mirror wrote that "For Ram Charan, Yevadu is essential to establish his status after Thoofan tanked at the box office. His character has two shades, and he tries his best to bring variations. He dances like there is no tomorrow and the choreography is a delight to watch."[52] A critic of Sify compared Charan's performance to his earlier films – Nayak and Thoofan and commented that he has done a fairly good job here.[53] Y. Sunita Chowdhary of The Hindu felt that Charan did well in the dance sequences than his acting in the role.[54]

He also began learning Karate for his role in mid May 2015.[62] For the role, he sported a tattoo of Bruce Lee on his hand.[63] The film collected more than ₹12.66 crore, on its opening day, registering the highest opening day collection of Ram Charan's film.[64] Over days the film didn't performed well at the box office[65] and was declared as a box-office bomb,[66] with a budget of ₹60 crore.[67] Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu once again criticised Charan's performance and wrote that "Charan dances like a dream, as always, and shows marked improvement as an actor. But what he needs is a project that will not belittle the huge fan base in the garb of masala."[68]</p>

As an actor, Ram Charan impresses in all the scenes that required high emotion. And as for the scenes where he had to be elevated as the hero, they will not disappoint his fans."[73] He performed his own stunts in the film.[74] He received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film. Charan made a cameo appearance in "Ammadu Let's Do Kummudu" song from the film Khaidi No. 150 (2017), alongside his father Chiranjeevi, Devi Sri Prasad, and Kajal Aggarwal.[75] The film marked the comeback of his father into the mainstream cinema after Shankar Dada Zindabad (2007).[76]

Rangasthalam could well be Ram Charan's"[86] Subhash K. Jha of The Free Press Journal commented Teja transforms in front of our eyes, adding "It is almost like watching a magic show where the entire appearance of the actor undergoes a sea change as we gawk in open-mouthed amazement."[87] After a long time, Ram Charan won several accolades including his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[88][89] In her article 5 Best Performances of Ram Charan Teja, S Behara of The Indian Express included Charan's performances in the films Chirutha (2007), Magadheera (2009), Orange (2010), Dhruva (2016) and Rangasthalam (2018).[90] In March 2018, Rajamouli confirmed that Charan would feature as one of the leads alongside N.
